# Python Mini Projects by Bren

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects that I created to practice and improve my programming skills. Each project is a small, functional CLI (Command Line Interface) tool with a specific goal.

## 📁 Projects included

- **Tip Calculator**: Calculates the total tip and how much each person should pay.
- **Guess the Number**: A game where the computer picks a number and you try to guess it.
- **Simple Calculator**: Performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **To-Do List**: A basic terminal-based to-do app to add and manage tasks.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- `main.py`: the main executable script
- `tests/`: unit tests using `pytest` (where applicable)
- `README.md`: project-specific instructions

## 📌 Purpose

These projects are part of my journey as a self-taught software developer. They helped me reinforce:
- Python syntax and logic
- CLI interactions with users
- Functions, loops, and basic error handling
- Writing clean and readable code
- Unit testing

I'm continuously improving these projects and adding new ones as I grow. Stay tuned 💫

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.10.11
- No external libraries required

## 🚀 How to run a project

`cd <project-folder`
`python main.py`
